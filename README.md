HackRice9 Scheduler

Be careful:
The view controller shouldn't store any data. It obtains all the data from the model: scheduler
The Scheduler.swift is the model that stores all the data


@Zoey & @Joyce
1. Fill in the TODO's in ViewController and Scheduler. 
2. @Joyce write init() methods for your classes to initialize objects of those classes.
